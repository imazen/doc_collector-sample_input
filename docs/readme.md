# Getting Started

Below is a basic installation guide, although a more comprehensive one can be found [on our website](http://www.imageresizing.net/docs/install).

#### Want the Source?

We use submodules - clone with `git clone -b develop --recursive https://github.com/imazen/resizer` or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` afterwards. Make sure to add a project reference.

<a name="installation"></a>

## Basic Installation Guide

**Important!**: The MVC Routing plugin is required on .NET4+

#### Install from NuGet

Nearly all [ImageResizer plugins are on NuGet (33+)](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=nathanaeljones).

Get the basics:
```
PM> Install-Package ImageResizer.WebConfig
PM> Install-Package ImageResizer.Plugins.DiskCache
PM> Install-Package ImageResizer.Plugins.PrettyGifs
PM> Install-Package ImageResizer.MvcWebConfig
```

<a name="install_plugin"></a>

#### Manual Plugin Installation

1. In *your* project, add a reference to the plugin DLL (or project, if you're using the source).
2. Configure the plugin to be installed at startup via (i) or (ii). 
  1.  In the [&lt;plugins /> section](#config_reference) of Web.config, insert `<add name="PluginName" />`
  2.  In `Application_Start`, create an instance of the plugin and install it.

```c#
  new PluginName().Install(ImageResizer.Configuration.Config.Current);
```
You will need need to add the appopriate namespace reference to access the plugin.

Most configuration and plugin installation issues can be resolved by checking ImageResizerâ€™s self-diagnostics page. If your local website is running at `http://localhost:5000/`, then you should browse to `http://localhost:5000/resizer.debug.ashx` to access it. See [the Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting section) for more details.

<a name="full_command"></a>

## Full Command Reference

#### Selecting a frame or page

* **frame=x** â€“ Choose which frame of an animated GIF to display.
* **page=x**â€“ Choose which page of a multi-page TIFF document to display.

#### Rotation & flipping

* **autorotate=true** Automatically rotates the image based on the EXIF info from the camera. (Requires the [AutoRotate plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/autorotate))
* **sflip=none\|x\|y\|xy** Flips the source image prior to processing (new in V3.1).
* **srotate=0\|90\|180\|270** Rotates the source image prior to processing (only 90 degree intervals) (new in V3.1).
* **rotate=degrees** â€“ Rotates the image any arbitrary angle (occurs after cropping).
* **flip=none\|x\|y\|xy** - Flips the image after everything is done.

#### Manual cropping

* **crop=(x1,y1,x2,y2)** â€“ Crop the image to the specified rectangle on the source image. You can use negative coordinates to specify bottom-right relative locations.
* **cropxunits** The width the x1 and x2 coordinates are relative, e.g., use '100' to make x1 and x2 percentages. Useful when you don't know the original image size.
* **cropyunits** The height the y1 and y2 coordinates are relative, e.g., use '100' to make y1 and y2 percentages. Useful when you don't know the original image size.


#### Sizing (and padding, autocropping, carving and stretching)

*Please note that width/height/maxwidth/maxheight do NOT include border, margin, or padding widths, and do not include the extra space used by rotation.* They constrain the image, not the canvas.

* **maxwidth, maxheight** â€“ Fit the image within the specified bounds, preserving aspect ratio.
* **width, height** â€“ Force the final width and/or height to certain dimensions. Whitespace will be added if the aspect ratio is different.
* **mode=max\|pad\|crop\|carve\|stretch** - How to handle aspect-ratio conflicts between the image and width+height. 'pad' adds whitespace, 'crop' crops minimally, 'carve' uses seam carving, 'stretch' loses aspect-ratio, stretching the image. 'max' behaves like maxwidth/maxheight (new in V3.1).
* **anchor=topleft\|topcenter\|topright\|middleleft\|middlecenter\|middleright\|bottomleft\|bottomcenter\|bottomright** How to anchor the image when padding or cropping (new in V3.1).
* **scale=both\|upscaleonly\|downscaleonly\|upscalecanvas** â€“ By default, images are never upscaled. Use &scale=both to upscale images if they are smaller than width and height.
* **zoom=0..infinity** - Scale the image by a multiplier. Useful for mobile devices and situations where you need to retain all the existing width/height/crop settings, but scale the result up or down. Defaults to 1. 0.5 produces a half-size image, 2 produces a double-size image.

#### Border, padding, margins and background colors

* **bgcolor=color name \| hex code (6-char).** Sets the background/whitespace color.
* **paddingWidth=px & paddingColor=color\|hex** paddingColor defaults to bgcolor, which defaults to white.
* **borderWidth=px, borderColor=color\|hex** borderColor defaults to transparent.
* **margin=3 or margin=5,5,10,10** Specify a universal margin or left,top,right,bottom widths (new in V3.1.

#### Output format

* **format=jpg\|png\|gif** - The output format to use.
* **quality** - Jpeg compression: 0-100 100=best, 90=very good balance, 0=ugly .
* **colors=2-255** â€“ Control the palette size of PNG and GIF images. If omitted, PNGs will be 24-bit ([PrettyGifs plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/prettygifs) required).

#### Misc

* **ignoreicc** - true|false. If true, the ICC profile embedded in the source image will be ignored.
* **cache** - always|no|default - Always forces the image to be cached even if it wasn't modified by the resizing module. Doesn't disable caching if it was modified.
* **process** - always|no|default - Always forces the image to be re-encoded even if it wasn't modified. Does not prevent the image from being modified.
* **dpi=90\|300\|600** - The DPI at which the image should be printed. Ignored by all browsers, most operating systems, and most printers.

#### [Watermark plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/watermark)

* **watermark** - The name of one or more watermark layers (or layer groups) to render.

#### [Image404 plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/image404)

* **404** - The path to the fallback image, or a named preset.

#### [Gradient plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/gradient)

* **color1,color2** - 6 or 8 digit hex values specifying the start and end gradient colors. 
* **angle** - 0 is horizontal. Degrees to rotate the gradient.
* **width/height** - The size of the gradient image.

#### [PrettyGifs plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/prettygifs)

* **colors** - 2 to 256 (the number of colors to allow in the output image palette). For Gifs and 8-bit PNGs.
* **dither**=true|false|4pass|30|50|79|[percentage] - How much to dither.

#### [SimpleFilters plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/simplefilters)

* &s.grayscale=true|y|ry|ntsc|bt709|flat  (true, ntsc, and y produce identical results)
* &s.sepia=true
* &s.alpha= 0..1
* &s.brightness=-1..1
* &s.contrast=-1..1
* &s.saturation=-1..1
* &s.invert=true

#### [AdvancedFilters plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/advancedfilters)

* &a.blur=radius - Gaussian blur with adjustable radius.
* &a.sharpen=radius - Gaussian sharpen with adjustable radius.
* &a.contrast=-1..1
* &a.saturation=-1..1
* &a.brightness=-1..1
* &a.equalize=true - Adjusts contrast, saturation, and brightness with curves based on the histogram. Good for adjusting slightly foggy or dark daytime photos. 
* &a.sepia=true - Sepia effect, slightly different from the one in SimpleFilters.
* &a.oilpainting=1..100 -Try `1` for impressionist, `100` for modern art :)
* &a.removenoise=1-100 - Not a blur effect - designed to remove color noise, 'pepper noise'. Very conservative, doesn't affect edges.

* **shadowOffset** - (x,y) how to offset the drop shadow.
* **shadowColor** - Named or hex color of the shadow.

#### [SpeedOrQuality plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/speedorquality)

* **speed**=0..5 - The amount of quality to sacrifice for speed - each value uses different settings and techniques, and may not support all features.

#### [Presets plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/presets)

* **preset**=name1,name2,name3 - A list of preset settings groups to apply. 

#### [WhitespaceTrimmer plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/whitespacetrimmer)

* **trim.threshold=80** - The threshold to use for trimming whitespace.
* **trim.percentpadding=0.5** - The percentage of padding to restore after trimming.

#### [WicBuilder](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/wic) & [FreeImageBuilder](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/freeimage)

* **builder=freeimage\|wic** - Enables the FreeImage or Wic pipeline instead of the default GDI pipeline. Special effect plugins not supported.

#### [FreeImageDecoder](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/freeimage), [WicDecoder](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/wic)

These act as fallback decoders, but you can tell them to try first by using 

* **decoder=wic\|freeimage**

#### [FreeImageEncoder](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/freeimage), [WicEncoder](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/wic)

In addition to jpeg quality and gif/png colors, you can configure the jpeg subsampling for both Wic and FreeImage.

* **subsampling**==444|422|420

<a name="managed_api"></a>

## Managed API examples

Most tasks with the managed API only require one line:
```c#
  ImageResizer.ImageBuilder.Current.Build(object source, object dest, ResizeSettings settings)
  
  or
  
  Bitmap b = ImageResizer.ImageBuilder.Current.Build(object source, ResizeSettings settings)
  
```

#### Object Source

May be a physical path (C:\..), an app-relative virtual path (~/folder/image.jpg), an Image, Bitmap, Stream, VirtualFile, or HttpPostedFile instance. 

#### Object Dest

May be a Stream instance, a physical path, or an app-relative virtual path.

#### ResizeSetting Settings

ResizeSettings is a friendly wrapper for a query string which provides named properties as well as the regular NameValueCollection interface.

You can create one like so:
```c#

  new ResizeSettings("maxwidth=200&maxheight=200")
  
  //or
  new ResizeSettings(Request.QueryString)
  
  //or
  var r = new ResizeSettings();
  r.MaxWidth = 200;
  r.MaxHeight = 300;
  
```

#### Examples

```c#
  using ImageResizer;
  
  //Converts a jpeg into a png
  
  ImageBuilder.Current.Build("~/images/photo.jpg","~/images/photo.png", 
                             new ResizeSettings("format=png"));
  
  //Crops to a square (in place)
  ImageBuilder.Current.Build("~/images/photo.jpg","~/images/photo.jpg", 
                             new ResizeSettings("width=100&height=200&crop=auto"));
``` 

#### Using Variables in the Destination Path (3.1.3+)

Variables include the correct extension <ext>, random GUID <guid>, source path <path>, source filename <filename>, <width>, <height>, and any settings value <settings.*>. 

This makes many scenarios much easier to code, and reduces room for error. Many users make critical errors in their upload code, such as not sanitizing filenames, or using the original extension (immediate server highjacking, here we go). 

With the new feature, a proper upload system is 3 lines:
```c#
    ImageJob i = new ImageJob(file, 
    "~/uploads/<guid>.<ext>", 
    new ResizeSettings("width=1600")); 
    i.CreateParentDirectory = true;
    i.Build();
```

You can also filter values. `<filename:A-Za-z0-9>` keeps only the alphanumeric characters from the original filename.

# Nifty Tricks

<a name="watermark"></a>

## Watermark Images Based on Folder Name or Display Size

The *PostRewrite* event is the last of the URL rewriting events, and can be used to enforce certain settings.

You can add an event handler during the Application\Start method in Global.asax.cs.

The following sample code applies a watermark to all images inside 'folder' that are probably above 100x100. I say probably, because the size estimation is based on the assumption that the original image is a 600x600 square. Given a 600x100 actual image size and the querystring "?height=99", the image could escape watermarking and display at 594x99.

So, with this code, you can only know that *one* of the dimensions will be less than 100px - you can't know that both will be.
```c#
  Config.Current.Pipeline.PostRewrite += delegate(IHttpModule sender, HttpContext context, IUrlEventArgs ev) {
      //Check folder
      string folder = VirtualPathUtility.ToAbsolute("~/folder");
      if (ev.VirtualPath.StartsWith(folder, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) {
          //Estimate final image size, based on the original image being 600x600. 
          Size estimatedSize = ImageBuilder.Current.GetFinalSize(new System.Drawing.Size(600,600),
              new ResizeSettings(ev.QueryString));
          if (estimatedSize.Width > 100 || estimatedSize.Height > 100){
              //It's over 100px, apply watermark
              ev.QueryString["watermark"] = "Sun_256.png";
          }
      }
  };
```

#### Important note

While the above enforces watermarking on all processed images, the `process=no` command can disable processing of the image completely, avoiding all resizing and watermarking.

To prevent this, you should add some more code inside PostRewrite
```c#
  Config.Current.Pipeline.PostRewrite += delegate(IHttpModule sender, HttpContext context, IUrlEventArgs ev) {
      //Check folder
      string folder = VirtualPathUtility.ToAbsolute("~/folder");
      if (ev.VirtualPath.StartsWith(folder, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) {
          //Estimate final image size, based on the original image being 600x600.
          Size estimatedSize = ImageBuilder.Current.GetFinalSize(new System.Drawing.Size(600,600),
                          new ResizeSettings(ev.QueryString));
          if (estimatedSize.Width > 100 || estimatedSize.Height > 100){
              //It's over 100px, apply watermark
              ev.QueryString["watermark"] = "Sun_256.png";
              //Force processing if it's an image
              if (Config.Current.Pipeline.IsAcceptedImageType(ev.VirtualPath))
                ev.QueryString["process"] = "Always";
          }
      }
  };

## Generate Thumbnails and Multiple Sizes to Disk

While the ImageResizer shines at on-the-fly image processing, you can also use it to drastically simplify pre-processing and ahead-of-time resizing as well. **We strongly recommend using the dynamic method instead of pre-generating your images, as pre-generating versions reduces agility and flexibility.** In the examples below, only one line is required to perform all the image decoding, format conversion, processing, resizing, and re-encoding. The rest is path/filename logic. Two different solutions are presented - 1 for processing images as they are uploaded, and another for processing images that are already saved to disk.

#### During Upload

This method generates 3 versions of an image as it is uploaded, adding a \_thumb, \_medium, and \_large suffix to each filename. Uploaded files are named using a generated GUID, as uploaded file names are never safe for use as-is. Even with proper sanitization (alphanumeric filtering AND length limiting), you will encounter duplicates using uploaded filenames on your server.
```c#
  Dictionary<string, string> versions = new Dictionary<string, string>();
  //Define the versions to generate
  versions.Add("_thumb", "width=100&height=100&crop=auto&format=jpg"); //Crop to square thumbnail
  versions.Add("_medium", "maxwidth=400&maxheight=400&format=jpg"); //Fit inside 400x400 area, jpeg
  versions.Add("_large", "maxwidth=1900&maxheight=1900&format=jpg"); //Fit inside 1900x1200 area
  
  //Loop through each uploaded file
  foreach (string fileKey in HttpContext.Current.Request.Files.Keys) {
      HttpPostedFile file = HttpContext.Current.Request.Files[fileKey];
      if (file.ContentLength <= 0) continue; //Skip unused file controls.
      
      //Get the physical path for the uploads folder and make sure it exists
      string uploadFolder = MapPath("~/uploads");
      if (!Directory.Exists(uploadFolder)) Directory.CreateDirectory(uploadFolder);
      
      //Generate each version
      foreach (string suffix in versions.Keys) {
          //Generate a filename (GUIDs are best).
          string fileName = Path.Combine(uploadFolder, System.Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + suffix);

          //Let the image builder add the correct extension based on the output file type
          fileName = ImageBuilder.Current.Build(file, fileName, new ResizeSettings(versions[suffix]), false, true);
      }
      
  }

```

#### After Upload

This example method generates 3 versions of the specified file, and returns a list of the final path names.

For example,
```c#
  GenerateVersions("~/images/image.jpg")
```
Will generate
  /images/image\_thumb.jpg
  /images/image\_medium.jpg
  /images/image\_large.jpg

And will return a list of those paths.

```c#
  public IList<string> GenerateVersions(string original) {
      Dictionary<string, string> versions = new Dictionary<string, string>();
      //Define the versions to generate and their filename suffixes.
      versions.Add("_thumb", "width=100&height=100&crop=auto&format=jpg"); //Crop to square thumbnail
      versions.Add("_medium", "maxwidth=400&maxheight=400format=jpg"); //Fit inside 400x400 area, jpeg
      versions.Add("_large", "maxwidth=1900&maxheight=1900&format=jpg"); //Fit inside 1900x1200 area


      string basePath = ImageResizer.Util.PathUtils.RemoveExtension(original);

      //To store the list of generated paths
      List<string> generatedFiles = new List<string>();

      //Generate each version
      foreach (string suffix in versions.Keys)
          //Let the image builder add the correct extension based on the output file type
          generatedFiles.Add(ImageBuilder.Current.Build(original, basePath + suffix, 
            new ResizeSettings(versions[suffix]), false, true));

      return generatedFiles;   
  }
```

## Convert and Resize Images as They Are Uploaded

Resizing and processing images as they are uploaded is very straightforward. Most of the required code is about paths and directories.

The following sample code generates a GUID filename for each upload, determines the appropriate file extension that is needed, then resizes/crops/formats the image according to the specified ResizeSettings.
```c#
  //Loop through each uploaded file
  foreach (string fileKey in HttpContext.Current.Request.Files.Keys) 
  {
    HttpPostedFile file = HttpContext.Current.Request.Files[fileKey];
    if (file.ContentLength <= 0) continue; //Skip unused file controls.
    
    //The resizing settings can specify any of 30 commands.. See http://imageresizing.net for details.
    //Destination paths can have variables like <guid> and <ext>, or 
    //even a santizied version of the original filename, like <filename:A-Za-z0-9>
    ImageResizer.ImageJob i = new ImageResizer.ImageJob(file, "~/uploads/<guid>.<ext>", new ImageResizer.ResizeSettings( 
                "width=2000;height=2000;format=jpg;mode=max"));
    i.CreateParentDirectory = true; //Auto-create the uploads directory.
    i.Build();
  }
```

#### For VB.NET Users

```vbnet
  'Loop through each uploaded file
  For Each fileKey As String In HttpContext.Current.Request.Files.Keys
      Dim file As HttpPostedFile = HttpContext.Current.Request.Files(fileKey)
      If (file.ContentLength > 0) Then 'Skip unused file controls.
        'The resizing settings can specify any of 30 commands.. See http://imageresizing.net for details.
        'Destination paths can have variables like <guid> and <ext>, or 
        'even a santizied version of the original filename, like <filename:A-Za-z0-9>
        Dim i As ImageResizer.ImageJob = New ImageResizer.ImageJob(file, "~/uploads/<guid>.<ext>", New ImageResizer.ResizeSettings("width=2000;height=2000;format=jpg;mode=max"))
        i.CreateParentDirectory = True 'Auto-create the uploads directory.
        i.Build()
      End If
  Next
```

# Troubleshooting

<a name="self_diagnostics"></a>

## Accessing Self-Diagnostics

Most configuration and plugin installation issues can be resolved by checking ImageResizerâ€™s self-diagnostics page. If your local website is running at `http://localhost:5000/`, then you can visit it at `http://localhost:5000/resizer.debug.ashx`.

If youâ€™re not using ImageResizer from a web app, you can access the page as a string via `ImageResizer.Configuration.Config.Current.GetDiagnosticsPage()` or write it to disk with `ImageResizer.Configuration.Config.Current.WriteDiagnosticsTo(string path)`. 

#### Diagnostics Page Not Working?

By default, the Diagnostics plugin uses the same setting as [customErrors](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h0hfz6fc%28v=vs.100%29.aspx) (which defaults to Localhost). Thus, if you can see ASP.NET error messages, you will also be able to get the diagnostics page. This ensures that the diagnostics page never exposes data to a host that doesn't already have access to detailed error messages. 

To override, add one of the following to the &lt;resizer&gt; section.
```xml
  <diagnostics enableFor="AllHosts" />
  <diagnostics enableFor="Localhost" />
  <diagnostics enableFor="None" />

```

#### ASP.NET MVC Notes

If you can't access the diagnostics page, make sure the [MvcRoutingShim plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/mvcroutingshim) is installed.

<a name="error_messages"></a>

## Getting Detailed Error Messages

If some images are not displaying correctly, you *must* visit the image url directly to get the exact error message.

The image URL is **not** the same as the page URL; viewing the broken image icons on the parent page doesn't tell us anything useful.

#### How to Open the Image URL Directly

* In Chrome, right-click on the broken image and choose "Open Image in New Tab".
* In Firefox, right-click and choose "View Image".
* In IE, right-click the image and choose "Properties". Copy and paste the "Address" (URL) field contents into the address bar of a new window.

#### Once You're Viewing the Image URL Directly

If you do not get a specific error message, you must enable detailed error messages on your ASP.NET site.

If you have local access to the server, you can set the [customErrors mode](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h0hfz6fc%28v=vs.100%29.aspx) to RemoteOnly and access the URLs using "localhost".

Otherwise, you may need to temporarily set customErrors to "Off", so you can get error messages from a remote location. **Temporarily is the key word!** Detailed error messages are considered a security risk and have enabled certain types of attacks to function. They should not be enabled for more than a few hours at most on a publicly accessible server.

You may also have to **temporarily** change &lt;deployment retail to "False" for the customErrors setting to take effect. 

The customErrors setting is case-sensitive; use "Off", "On", and "RemoteOnly".

## What Might Be Wrong

To get support or use this guide, [make sure you get the detailed error message from visiting the image URL directly](#error_messages). This guide cannot offer a solution to a generic 500 error, 404 error, or a "broken image icon", as those symptoms are far to generic to be useful. 

If this page doesn't resolve your issue, [visit the Support page](http://www.imageresizing.net/support) for information about the bug bounty and free support requirements.

#### Server Error in '/' Application. Out of memory.

You might be trying to resize certain large images for the first time. Even a 15MB jpg, however, uncompresses to about 80MB in bitmap form (depending on the compression level). If you are resizing to a 2MB jpg (15MB BMP), memory requirements for the operation are roughly 110MB (15 + 80 + 15). If you plan on using ImageResizer for very high-resolution photos (above 8MP), we suggest making sure you have ample amounts of RAM. 400MB to 1GB is usually plenty for the average web site with disk caching enabled.

#### Could not load type 'ImageResizer.InterceptModule'

Potential causes:

1. Your website has  a 'sub-site' (Application Folder) inside it. Application Folders inherit all Web.config settings from their parent sites, yet expect to have their own copies of all the dlls referenced by those settings in their own /bin folder. You can resolve this problem by (a) changing the app folder to a virtual folder, (b) adding a copy of ImageResizer.dll and plugins into the /bin folder inside that application also, or (c) using `<remove />` statements in the child Web.config to cancel out the inherited `<add />` statements from the parent Web.config. Option (c) will disable image resizing within the sub-application.
2. You didn't copy ImageResizer.dll into the /bin folder.
3. The ImageResizer.dll file in /bin is corrupt. Verify it has the correct file size and version number, or re-copy it from the download. 

#### Blank page, invalid image error in browser, or Page cannot be displayed on image URL.

If this happens when the image has a querystring:

* You are using ASP.NET MVC, but do not have the [MvcRoutingShim](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/mvcroutingshim) plugin enabled. Both MVC and the ImageResizer are trying to answer the request, and corrupting the response.

If this only happens when the image *doesn't* have a querystring, you're running IIS6, and you have mapped individual extensions to ASP.NET instead of wildcard mapping:

* See [this fantastic Microsoft KB article for ways to fix this](http://support.microsoft.com/Default.aspx?kbid=909641).

Keep reading if it's a `404: File Not Found error`

#### The type or namespace name "ImageResizer" could not be found

When using the ImageResizer from a .NET project that is not a web project you may get the following build error:

> The type or namespace name "ImageResizer" could not be found (are you missing a using directive or assembly reference?)

This is caused by using a Client Profile version of .NET instead of the Full version. You can change this in Project Properties -> Application -> Target Framework. The ImageResizer requires the full version, as it is also designed to support ASP.NET usage and references the System.Web assembly (which is not part of the client profile version of .NET).

#### File not found

Potential causes:

1. You are using the .jpg.ashx syntax, and you did not register the HttpModule properly in both places of your Web.config file.
2. You are using the .jpg.ashx syntax, but you're not using a query string. You should drop the '.ashx' unless you actually want to process the file.
3. You are using ASP.NET MVC, but do not have the [MvcRoutingShim plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/mvcroutingshim) installed.
4. You have Precompilation enabled, and are using an image provider. [This is caused by a long-standing bug in the .NET framework](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12397/net-virtualpathproviders-and-pre-compilation).

#### File not found for JSON requests (Faces, RedEye plugins)

1. You have not copied Newtonsoft.Json.dll into the /bin folder, and are using .NET 4.0.

#### Image appears original size

Potential causes: 

1. You did not register the HttpModule properly in both places of your Web.config file.
2. You are using IIS 6 (or earlier), or IIS7 Classic Pipeline, and are not using the .jpg.ashx syntax, and you have not [mapped all requests to the ASP.NET runtime](http://www.imageresizing.net/docs/cleanurls). 
3. You are using ASP.NET MVC (and have conflicting routes), but do not have the [MvcRoutingShim plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/mvcroutingshim) installed.
4. You are mistyping the querystring commands. 
5. The original image is smaller than the size you are requesting, and you are not using `&scale=both` (The default behavior is to never upscale images, [but this can be changed](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/defaultsettings)).

#### File not found only on images without a querystring

Possible causes

1. You are using the .ashx syntax. This is normal; you should only add the .ashx suffix if you are also adding a querystring to tell ImageResizer to do something.

2. The images are from S3 or Sql: The S3Reader and SqlReader plugins require AspNetHostingPermission to register themselves as VirtualPathProviders. If they lack permission, they register as IVirtualImageProviders instead - but then only the image resizer can find them, and the image resizer only accepts requests with a querystring that uses one of the defined commands.

3. Alternatively, you may have a URL rewriting event that is affecting the path names.

#### This type of page is not served. (HTTP 403 error)

  Description: The type of page you have requested is not served because it has been explicitly forbidden.  The extension '.jpg' may be incorrect.   Please review the URL below and make sure that it is spelled correctly. 

Possible causes

1. You aren't logged in. ImageResizer obeys your URL Authorization rules, so don't expect to view images where you can't visit .aspx pages. 
2. You are trying to access a S3 bucket or Remote URL that is not authorized.

This generic error message often hides a more descriptive message, but that message is always guaranteed to be a "Not Authorized To View this Content" kind of error.



#### Method Not Found (System.MissingMethodException)

  Server Error in '/' Application. 
  ------------------------------ 
  Method not found: 'Void System.Web.HttpContext.RemapHandler(System.Web.IHttpHandler)'.
  Exception Details: System.MissingMethodException: Method not found: 'Void 
  System.Web.HttpContext.RemapHandler(System.Web.IHttpHandler)'.
  
This error occurs when you do not have .NET 2.0 Service Pack 2 applied. No other conditions cause this error. The RemapHanlder method was added in .NET 2.0 SP2, and is required by this product.
Yes, it is possible to have .NET 3, 3.5, and .NET 4 installed (and up-to-date), yet not have .NET SP2 installed. This peculiar circumstance has been verified on over 5 machines.

#### Server object error 'ASP 0178 : 80070005'

  Server object error 'ASP 0178 : 80070005'
  Server.CreateObject Access Error
  The call to Server.CreateObject failed while checking permissions. 
  Access is denied to this object.

This error usually means that the user that the ASP website is running under does not have NTFS permissions to the ImageResizer dlls. 
Right click the `C:\Program Files\ImageResizingNet\v3` folder and choose Properties, Security, hit Edit, then click Add, type in the user name your website is running under, hit OK, then check Read & Execute, and hit OK, then Apply.

On IIS6, this [account is typically IUSR_ComputerName](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/3648346f-e4f5-474b-86c7-5a86e85fa1ff.mspx?mfr=true), but on IIS7, the account is usually `NETWORK SERVICE` or (if you're not use a default app pool), a custom user account. You'll need to open IIS and inspect the appropriate Application Pool to find out which account you need to give permissions to. 

If that fails, providing Readonly access to the Everyone group should work, but that may not be acceptable if you have highly-isolated application pools which you don't want to be able to access the ImageResizer dlls files.

If you still encounter issues, perform a reinstall with COMInstaller.exe, and save the install log. If the reinstall doesn't fix the problem, send the install log to support@imageresizing.net to get help with your issue.

#### System.Security.SecurityException

  System.Security.SecurityException: Request for the 
  permission of type 'System.Configuration.ConfigurationPermission, 
  System.Configuration, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, 
  PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' failed

This can occur in certain medium or low trust environments. To correct, set `requirePermission="false"` on the resizer section declaration in Web.config.
```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
  <configuration>
    <configSections>
      <section name="resizer" type="ImageResizer.ResizerSection,ImageResizer" requirePermission="false" />
    </configSections>
    ...
```

#### Error parsing Web.Config

If you are using NuGet and recently upgraded from an older release, there may be duplicate XML elements in Web.Config. Delete the one lacking the requirePermission="false" attribute.
```xml
  <section name="resizer" type="ImageResizer.ResizerSection"/>
  <section name="resizer" type="ImageResizer.ResizerSection" requirePermission="false"/>
```

#### Quality loss when resizing 8-bit Grayscale Jpeg images

This is a known bug in GDI+. GDI+ opens 8-bit grayscale Jpeg images as 4-bit images. Here's the [bug report at Microsoft Connect](http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/649605/gdi-and-wic-opening-an-8bpp-grayscale-jpeg-results-in-quality-loss).

The workaround is to use WIC or FreeImage for these requests. Any of the following plugins will solve the problem

1. WicDecoder - Install, then add `&decoder=wic` to affected URLs. (best quality)
2. WicBuilder - Install, then add `&builder=wic` to affected URLs. Faster, but slightly lower quality than #1 (nearly imperceptible)
3. FreeImageDecoder - Install, then add `&decoder=freeimage`
4. FreeImageBuilder - Install, then add `&builder=freeimage`. Slowest, but highest quality.
 with `builder=freeimage` or `builder=wic`

#### Performance issues or error messages when using a SAN.

This is tricky to get right - [read the full article here](http://imageresizing.net/docs/howto/avoid-network-limit).

#### Losing transparency when working with GIF images

You must have the [PrettyGifs](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/prettygifs) plugin installed to get high-quality, transparent GIF and 8-bit PNG results. You may also want the [AnimatedGifs](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/animatedgifs) plugin.

#### SizeLimitException - The dimensions of the output image (4800x2700) exceed the maximum permitted dimensions of 3200x3200.

By default, ImageResizer limits the output size of images to 3200x3200. This can be changed [by configuring (or removing) the SizeLimiting plugin](http://www.imageresizing.net/plugins/sizelimiting).

#### 0-byte response with status 200 returned when DiskCache is enabled

IIS 7+ gives you granular control over which IIS components can be installed. If the Static Content module is not installed, you will get empty responses for disk-cached content. 

If you have enabled asyncWrites, the first request per URL will succeed, but all subsequent operations will fail.

You need at minimum the following IIS modules installed for correct operation:

* Static Content
* HTTP Errors
* HTTP Redirection
* URL Authorization
* .NET Extensibility 4.5
* ASP.NET 4.5
