# CopyMetadata plugin

**Warning. This plugin can only *copy* metadata, not read, or return it. It will be replaced in V4 with a more capable plugin.** 

Copies all metadata from the source image to the destination image. 

Metadata specific to original encoding of image (like width, height, etc), is of course discarded and replaced. See [the source for a comprehensive list of discarded metadata](https://github.com/imazen/resizer/blob/master/Plugins/CopyMetadata/CopyMetadataPlugin.cs#L68).

## Installation

Install `ImageResizer.Plugins.CopyMetadata`, *or*...

1. Reference ImageResizer.Plugins.CopyMetadata.dll
2. Add `<add name="CopyMetadata" />` to the `<plugins />` section.

## Syntax

* `copymetadata=true`

## Special ability when installed alongside the Faces plugin

* c.focus=faces - Perfoms on-the-fly face detection and uses those coordinates. Can be resource intensive, so disk caching is reccommended.
